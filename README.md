You'll need Docker installed and running, probably on a Linux or Mac machine (tested with Docker Version 1.12.0-rc2-beta16). It's important you don't use an older version of Docker on Mac because it needs to run on the El Capitan hypervisor.

```
npm install
node index.js
```

visit http://localhost:3000/docker
